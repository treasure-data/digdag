  # To use Gmail SMTP server, you need to do either of:
  #   a) Generate a new app password at
  #      https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords
  #      This needs to enable 2-Step Verification first.
  #   b) Enable access for less secure apps at
  #      https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps
  #      This works even if 2-Step Verification is not enabled.
